# CFG-NeRF
Sparse-view NeRF for large-scale ancient architecture reconstruction has geometric misalignment, poor frequency synergy and material distortion; we propose CFG-NeRF (with MI-MLPâ€™s coordinate injection, multi-scale pyramid, Cross-Modal Gated Attention) that hits SOTA on Zhantan Temple Dataset (22.73dB PSNR, 0.735 SSIM, 0.174 LPIPS).
